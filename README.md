# Unity_HDRPShaders
Some shaders I created with shader graph. 
Feel free to use them in any way you want. Credit would be appreciated but is not necessary.

## Shaders
### Grid
A simple grid with changable scaling, offset and colors. Perfect for blocking out levels or debugging.

## Subgraphs
### Pixelate
Pixelates a given texture to a given resolution.

## How to use
To install a shader, just download the .shadergraph file and pull it into your assets.
